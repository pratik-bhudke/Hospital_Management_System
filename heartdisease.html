<h2>What are the symptoms of a heart attack in women?</h2>
<p>
Like in men, the most common heart attack symptom for women is pain or discomfort in the chest. 
However, women can also have a heart attack without having any chest pain. </p>

Some of the other symptoms women might experience include:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling out of breath <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain that runs along the neck, jaw, or upper back <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nausea, vomiting or indigestion <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexplained sweating <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden or overwhelming fatigue<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizziness <br>


<h2>What can I do to protect myself from heart disease?</h2>
For both men and women, the biggest factors that contribute to heart disease are <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smoking <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high blood pressure<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high cholesterol <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family history <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age <br>
Take a moment to consider your lifestyle, family history and your general health. With this information, you and your family doctor can assess your risk and make a plan to avoid potential problems. Although you can't do much about your family history or your age, you can make lifestyle changes to avoid many of the other risk factors (see below).
